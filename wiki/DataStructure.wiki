= Diagram of Data Structure =

The parsing result of GBParsy is organized with five structures that are represented by a box. A large bold title such as gb_data represents the name of the structure and items in a box represent elements of the structure. A variable name and its data type in C language are denoted on the left- and the right-side of the colon, respectively. A number in parenthesis links with the number in [http://code.google.com/p/gbfp/wiki/ParsingExample Example of a parsing result] and it represents a datum block stored in the variable.
